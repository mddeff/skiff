# WatchTower install / update — the single implementation, shared by every
# CCC entry point.
#
# Why one file: CCC reaches users through `curl | bash`, Homebrew, the DMG,
# Docker and a plain `git clone`, and each of those used to have its own idea
# of whether WatchTower gets installed. On macOS the honest answer was "no
# path installs it", while the README claimed it shipped by default. What
# every path DOES have in common is that it ends up executing run.sh, so
# run.sh and scripts/install.sh both call this script and get the same chain.
#
# WatchTower is CCC's queue engine, not an optional extra: without it the
# dashboard silently loses worker dispatch (filed tickets never spawn
# anything), plan-to-fleet import, WT-tracked drain and delivery receipts.
# Nothing here is ever fatal — CCC still boots on its built-in fallback.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/install-watchtower.sh        # run the chain
#   source scripts/install-watchtower.sh   # define the functions only (tests)
#
# Environment:
#   CCC_SKIP_WATCHTOWER=1           opt out entirely
#   CCC_PYTHON                      interpreter to install INTO. It must be the
#                                   one that runs server.py: CCC does
#                                   `import watchtower.queue` in-process, so it
#                                   needs the library and not just the `wt`
#                                   binary — which is what rules out pipx.
